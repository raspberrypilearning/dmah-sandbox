## Dino-exercise

- Create two lists - `exercise`{:class="block3variables"} and `new session`{:class="block3variables"}

- When you start, clear the two lists and add exercises to the `exercise`{:class="block3variables"} list.

```blocks3
when flag clicked
delete all of [exercise v]
delete all of [new session v]
add (pressups) to [exercise v]
add (situps) to [exercise v]
```
